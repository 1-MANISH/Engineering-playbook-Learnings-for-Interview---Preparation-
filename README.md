# Engineering Playbook 🚀

This repository documents my **daily learning, experiments, and projects** across  
**DSA, AI/LLMs, Web Development, Web3, and DevOps**.

The goal is simple:  
> **Upskills/upgrade  engineering fundamentals, ship real systems, and crack a high-impact software role.**

----

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Full Stack Developer** with experience across **Microsoft, Philips, Cold Pressery, and Mercor**, working on scalable, production-grade systems.

I have built :
- Real-time applications (WebSockets, WebRTC)
- Role-based full-stack platforms


This repo reflects how I **learn like an engineer, not just a tutorial consumer**.

## 🧠 What This Repo Covers

### 1️⃣ Data Structures & Algorithms (Foundations)
- Core DSA concepts revisited with **pattern-based thinking**
- Focus on **problem intuition, constraints, and trade-offs**

📌 **Note:**  
Advanced & pattern-based DSA (DP, Graphs, Greedy, Segment Trees, etc.)  
is maintained **separately** here 👉  
🔗 **Advanced DSA Repo:** `https://github.com/1-MANISH/Advanced-DSA---learning`

---

### 2️⃣ AI / LLM Engineering - 🙌 NOT ON FOCUSED FOR NOW
- Neural Networks & Attention (from scratch)
- Transformers, KV Cache, GQA, MLA
- HuggingFace end-to-end workflows
- Vector Databases & RAG
- Agent systems (memory, tools, evals)
- Finetuning & RL-based optimization
- Observability, tracing & evaluations

**Projects**
- Agent framework from first principles  
- RL finetuning + custom evals  
- Devin-like task automation system  
- Memory framework for long-running agents  

---

### 3️⃣ Web Development (System-Oriented)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (deep internals)
- Node.js vs Browser runtime
- REST, WebSockets, WebRTC
- SQL/NOSQL  - MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prisma/Drizzle
- TypeScript, Turborepo, Bun
- React, Next.js, Tailwind
- Redis 

**Projects**
- Todo app (clean architecture)
- Real-world frontend clones
- Trading app
- Competitive-programming inspired UI tools

---

### 4️⃣ Web3 & Blockchain (Solana-focused)
- Blockchain & cryptography basics
- Solana architecture & PDAs
- Token programs & DeFi primitives
- Rust (beginner → advanced)
- Anchor framework
- Indexing, MPC, hybrid Web2 + Web3 systems

**Projects**
- DEX
- CEX
- Wallet
- Prediction market
- Frontends + tests for on-chain contracts

---

### 5️⃣ DevOps & Infrastructure
- Linux, Bash, VMs, Bare Metal
- Reverse proxies & process management
- Docker & container runtimes
- Kubernetes (fundamentals → advanced)
- CI/CD, Monitoring & Observability
- IaC, CDNs, Object Storage
- Firecracker & sandboxing

**Projects**
- e2b-style execution environments
- Replit-like infra experiments
- Cloudflare Workers-based systems

---



### 6️⃣ System Design (Foundations)
- HLD
- LLD

📌 **Note:**  
For the system design ,  
 maintained repo **separately** here 👉  
🔗 **Advanced DSA Repo:** `https://github.com/1-MANISH/System-Design---HLD-and-LLD`


---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation Strategy

This repository is intentionally structured to help with:
- **DSA interviews** (clarity + patterns)
- **System Design** (scalability, trade-offs)
- **Full Stack interviews** (end-to-end ownership)
- **AI/LLM roles** (agents, RAG, evals)
- **Infra-aware engineering roles**

I focus on:
- Writing clean, explainable code
- Understanding *why* systems work
- Documenting learnings clearly

---

## 📅 How I Use This Repo
- Daily commits (learning + code)
- Notes + implementations side by side
- Small experiments > big theory dumps
- Production mindset even while learning

---

## 📌 Final Note

This repo is **not a course dump**.  
It is a **living engineering journal** — showing consistency, curiosity, and depth.

If you’re a recruiter or engineer reviewing this:
> You’ll see *how I think*, not just *what I know*.
